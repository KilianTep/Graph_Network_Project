# Graph_Network_Project

This project aims to model flu epidemic in the U.S during 2016-2017.

We have based our model on SIR model and we have tested our model with Graph Network simulation

#Code

The folder Code gathers all python code to simulate flu epidemic on Graph network
episim.py simulates a random graph with a SIR model 
sir_comp.py and sir_subgraph.py is the code related to SIR Model.

#Data

Data comes from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/, Center for disease control and prevention.
- The file WHO_NREVSS_Clinical_Labs_all_states.csv give the number of positive case of flu in each state during each week of  2016-2017
- The file dataView2065_3.csv give the vaccinetad ratio in each states.
